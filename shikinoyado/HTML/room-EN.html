            <h2>Four Seasons Hermitage</h2>
            <p>The symbolic room of Shikino Yado, bearing our inn's name. Each season, the alcove is adorned with hanging scrolls and flowers that change the room's character with each visit. From the wide veranda, you hear the gentle murmur of the small stream flowing through the inn's heart. Morning birdsong, evening insect songs echo softly – breathing naturally deepens in this silence. While honoring Japanese tradition, the room offers modern comfort, making it ideal for extended stays.</p>

            <h2>Elegance Room</h2>
            <p>A room pursuing quiet sophistication rather than lavishness. Traditional designs – gold-leaf doors and mother-of-pearl inlays – are subtly woven throughout, while the overall space remains gently refined. Opening the shoji reveals distant mountains beyond.
