            <h3><span class="spring">Spring</span> Menu</h3>            
            <p>Spring is the season of budding. Our chefs cherish the flavors of wild vegetables that bravely emerge in the still chilly air and the pure taste of river fish. Grilled bamboo shoots, sweetfish with kinome miso, and colorful nanohana (rapeseed) ohitashi adorn the table. The appearance is centered around pale greens and pinks, and when tasted, a light, subtle bitterness and sweetness spread, making you feel, "Ah, spring has come." Ingredients are sourced fresh from local markets and mountains in the early morning, ensuring we capture the peak of their season.</p>

            <h3><span class="summer">Summer</span> Menu</h3>
            <p>Summer dishes are designed to evoke a sense of "coolness." We grill iwana (mountain trout) raised in clear streams over charcoal, resulting in a crispy exterior and moist interior. Cold dishes made with fresh tomatoes and cucumbers from local farms refresh the body tired from the heat. Additionally, sashimi served on a bed of ice looks refreshing and offers a transparent taste that spreads in the mouth. The dishes are vibrant and invigorating, reminiscent of summer festival nights.</p>

            <h3><span class="autumn">Autumn</span> Menu</h3>
            <p>Autumn is the season of harvest. This is when our chefs showcase their skills the most. Matsutake mushrooms from local mountains are prepared in dobin mushi (teapot steam) or grilled over charcoal, enhancing their fragrant aroma. Sanma (Pacific saury), ginkgo nuts, and chestnuts are used in rice dishes that evoke a sense of nostalgia. We decorate the presentation with autumn leaves, allowing you to feel the deepening of the season visually. The flavors are rich and robust, quietly concluding the echoes of summer while hinting at the preparations for winter.</p>

            <h3><span class="winter">Winter</span> Menu</h3>
            <p>Winter focuses on hearty dishes that warm the body. Essential nabe (hot pot) dishes during the snowy season are made with plenty of duck meat and local vegetables, simmered slowly in a special broth. Fatty buri (yellowtail) and crab are enjoyed as sashimi or shabu-shabu, allowing you to fully savor the flavors of the ingredients. The aroma rising with the white steam relaxes both the mind and body, making your time away from home special. The rich flavors unique to winter resonate with the quiet snowy landscape, leaving a deep aftertaste.</p>
